                <p>Astronomy is the alpha and omega of all science. Astronomy should be the first
                    science that kids are taught, because everything stems from cosmology and 
                    astrophysics. ... And because the process of trying to make sense of the universe
                     is so far-reaching and ambitious, astronomy is now inherently interdisciplinary</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An Astronomerâ€™s objective is to understand the universe.</li>
                        <li>To achieve this tremendous challenge, an astronomer must 
                            balance a great deal of analytic thinking and logic with 
                            imagination and intuition.</li>
                        <li>Astronomers apply several branches of math--algebra, statistics,
                            geometry, and scientific notation--to help answer the questions:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li>What are stars and planets?</li>
                        <li>How did they evolve?</li>
                        <li>Why does the night sky look the way it does?</li>
                        <li>Does life exist among the stars?</li>

                <p>According to research, the universe is approximately
                    13.8 billion years old. How did scientists determine how many candles to put 
                    on the universe's birthday cake? They can determine the age of the universe 
                    using two different methods: by studying the oldest objects within the universe 
                    and "measuring how fast it is expanding.
